##Basic single page render example

A stripped down version of the Google 'vrview' repo - have a look around and it should be easy enough to figure about.

Base index.html calls render.html in an iframe with the image / video and parameters contained in a query string. For more information on using images / video and the parameters used see -

Provides a basic example and boilerplate for more complex projects. Take a look at index.html and have a play.
